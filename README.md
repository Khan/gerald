# Gerald

Trigger Gerald to run

This project is not maintained. We're releasing the code for others to refer to and learn from, but we are not open to pull requests or issues.

## Description

Gerald is intended to help developers keep track of changes to their code. At its core, Gerald is a GitHub Action that reads in rules from two files (`.github/NOTIFIED` and `.github/REVIEWERS`). If a pull request or a commit to a protected branch matches a rule, the people and teams that "own" the rule will be notified or requested for a review.

## Usage

To use Gerald in your repository, please read through the [Setup guide](./setup-files/Setup-README.md) and continue on to read through the [Usage guide](./setup-files/Gerald-README.md).
